Original quadprox-mobile app stopped working with Proxmox 4.

I found out, that just the URL changed from /vz/ to /lxc/.
After changing this fantastic app started working again.

I added my self-compiled version which stopped working with Proxmox 3!

Please try out:
QuadProx Mobile_it.quadrata.android.quad_prox_mob.apk
